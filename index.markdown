<!-- # About Me -->
I'm currently a PhD student in [Prof. Sandra Hirche](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home)'s ITR Lab at TU Munich. My research focuses on learning-based control and motion planning on robotics. In particular, I’m interested in leveraging generative model to learn the control policy of robots.

Previously, I worked as an R&D engineer at SYNTEC, one of the leading PC-based controller companies in Asia, where I developed motion planning algorithms in embedded systems. I received MSc degrees in Electrical Engineering and BSc degrees in Mechanical Engineering at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), where I worked on motion planning of robot manipulators with [Prof. Ming-Yang Cheng](https://www.ee.ncku.edu.tw/en/teacher/index2.php?teacher_id=143) and [Advance Technology Research Center, Delta Electronics, Inc.](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index).
