<!-- # About Me -->
I am currently a PhD student in the [ITR Lab](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/itr/startseite/) at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), supervised by [Prof. Sandra Hirche](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home), and a member of [RelAI](https://zuseschoolrelai.de/). My research focuses on the intersection of generative models and control theory for robotic systems.
Previously, I worked as an R&D engineer at [Syntec Technology](https://www.syntecclub.com/), developing trajectory planning algorithms.
